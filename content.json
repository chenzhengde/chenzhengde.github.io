The topics for this week: Computer representation of objects Cartesian co-ordinate system Points, lines and angles Trigonometry 三角函数 Vectors (unit vector) and vector calculations (addition, subtraction, scaling, dot product, cross product) 矢量和矢量计算 Matrices (dimension, transpose, square/symmetric/identity, inverse) and matrix calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) 矩阵和矩阵计算 因为矩阵的知识快忘光了，所以矩阵的部分写的比较多。 LectureComputer representation of objects Cartesian co-ordinate system都是笛卡尔平面直角坐标系的知识，不会的建议重开。 Points, lines and angles同上。 Trigonometry同上。 Vectors同上。 Matrices Techniques for applying transformations use matrices. 应用变换的技术使用矩阵。 A matrix is simply a set of numbers arranged in a rectangular format. 矩阵是一组按矩形形式排列的数字。 Each number is known as an element. 每个数字都是一个元素。 Capital letters are used to represent a matrix. 用大写字母表示矩阵。 Bold letters when printed (M), or underlined when written. 打印时加粗或下划线。 A matrix has dimensions that refer to the number of rows and the number of columns it has. 矩阵的维数指的是它的行数和列数 Dimensions of matricesThe dimensions of Matrix are (x * y). x is the number of rows in matrix and y is the columns.$$ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\\\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$$The dimensions of this matrix are (2*3). Transpose matrixWhen a matrix is rewritten so that its rows and columns are interchanged, then the resulting matrix is called the transpose of the original. 当一个矩阵被改写使它的行和列互换时，得到的矩阵叫做原矩阵的转置。The original A:$$ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\\\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$$The transpose matrix of A:$$ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 2 &amp; 5 \\\\ 3 &amp; 6 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$$ Square and symmetric matrices A square matrix is matrix where the number of rows equals the number of columns. 行列数量相同的是方阵。 A symmetric matrix is a square matrix where the rows and columns are such that its transponse is the same as the original matrix. 对角线对称的方阵是对称矩阵。 Identity matricesAn identity matrix, I is a square matrix with zeros everywhere except its diagonal elements which have a value of 1. 单位矩阵就是对角线是1，剩下的都是0的方阵。 Adding matrices Matrices A and B may be added if they have the same dimensions. That is, the corresponding elements may be added to yield a resulting matrix. The sum is commutative, i.e. A + B = B + A 加法交换律 Subtracting matricesMatrix B may be subtracted from matrix A if they have the same dimensions, i.e. the corresponding elements of B may be subtracted from those of A to yield a resulting matrix.The result is not commutative. Reversing the order of the matrices yields different results, i.e. A - B ≠ B -A ⚠️减法🈚️交换律! Multiplying matrices By a constant By a matrix - The rule for multiplying one matrix to another is simple: if the number of columns in the first matrix is the same as the number of rows in the second matrix, the multiplication can be done. 也就是必须要是(x * y)&amp;(y * z)，计算结果是(x * z)。 Matrix multiplication is not commutative. Reversing the order of the matrices yields different results. ⚠️矩阵的乘法也是没有交换律的！交换相乘的两个矩阵的位置会产生不同的结果。 Inverse matricesIf two matrices A and B, when multiplieid together, results in an indentity matrix I, then matrix A is the inverse of matrix B and vice versa, i.e.$$A * B = B * A = I$$$$A = B^{-1} and B = A^{-1}$$两个矩阵相乘是一个单位矩阵那这两个矩阵就是逆矩阵。 LabThe tutorial explains the C/C++ basics that will be used in CPT205 Computer Graphics.先自己研究一下Lab文档再来写这部分吧，这部分应该已解决在lab中遇到的问题位置。 References XJTLU CPT205 slides (Week2)","link":"/2021/08/29/Preview-CPT205-W2/"},{"title":"Preview INT201 W2","text":"This is the preview note of INT201 Week2.

This week we will focus on three following spots. understand the concepts of software processes and software process models; introduced to three generic software process models and when they might be used; know about the fundamental process activities of software requirements engineering, software development, testing, and evolution; IntroductionA software process is a set of related activities that leads to the production of a software product. These activites may involve the development of software from scratch 软件从零开始 by extending and modifying existing systems 扩展和修改现有系统 by configuring and integrating off-the-shelf software or system components 通过配置和集成现成的软件或系统组件 Software processes must include four activites that are fundamental to software engineering: software specification 软件规范 software design and implementation 软件设计与实现 software validation 软件验证 software evolution 软件进化They’re complex activities and include sub-activities.There’re also supporting process activities such as documentation and software configuration management. 还有支持过程活动，如文档和软件配置管理。 Software processes are categorized as either plan-driven or agile processes. 软件过程分为计划驱动过程和敏捷过程两种。 Plan-driven processes are processes where all of the process activities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan. 计划驱动的过程是指所有过程活动都提前计划，并根据该计划衡量进度的过程。 In agile processes, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements. 在敏捷过程中，计划是增量的，更容易改变过程以反映客户需求的变化。 Software Process ModelsA software process model is a simplified representation of a software process.软件过程模型是软件过程的简化表示。 The models in our discussionThe waterfall model 瀑布模型This takes the fundamental process activites of specification, development, validation, and evolution and represents them as separate process phases such as requirements specification, software design, implementation, testing, and so on. 它将基本的过程活动(如规格说明、开发、验证和演进)表示为独立的过程阶段，如需求规格说明、软件设计、实现、测试等等。 Incremental development 增量开发This approach interleaves the activities of specification, development, and validation. The system is developed as a series of versions (increments), with each version adding functionality to the previous version.这种方法将规范、开发和验证活动交织在一起。系统被开发为一系列版本(增量版本)，每个版本向前一个版本添加功能。 Reuse-oriented software engineering 面向重用的软件工程This approach is based on the existence of a significant number of reusable components. The system development process focuses on integrating these components into a system rather than developing them from scratch.这种方法是基于大量可重用组件的存在。系统开发过程关注于将这些组件集成到系统中，而不是从头开始开发它们。 These models are not mutually exclusive and are often used together, especially for large systems development. 这些模型不是相互排斥的，而且在大型系统开发中经常一起使用。 The waterfall modelThis model is known as the ‘waterfall model’ or software life cycle 生命循环. This is an example of a plan-driven process 计划驱动流程.该模型直接反应了以下的活动 Requirements analysis and definition 需求分析和定义 System and software design 系统和软件设计 Implementation and unit testing 实现和单元测试 Integration and system testing 集成和系统测试 Operation and maintenance 操作维护 In principle, the result of each phase is one or more documents that are approved (‘signed off’). The following phase should not start until the previous phase has finished. In practice, these stages overlap and feed information to each other. The software process is not a simple linear model but involves feedback from one phase to another. Documents produced in each phase may then have to be modified to reflect the changes made.原则上，每个阶段的结果是一个或多个文件被批准。在下一阶段应该直到前一阶段结束后才开始。实际上，这些阶段相互重叠并提供信息。软件过程不是一个简单的线性模型，而是涉及从一个阶段到另一个阶段的反馈。每个阶段产生的文件可能需要修改以反映所做的更改。 Because of the costs of producing and approving documents, iterations can be costly and involve significant rework. Therefore, after a small number of iterations, it is normal to freeze parts of the development, such as the specification, and to continue with the later development stages. Problems are left for later resolution, ignored, or programmed around. This premature freezing of development tasks may mean that the system won’t deliver what the users are expecting.由于生产和批准文件的成本，迭代可能是昂贵的，并涉及重大的返工。因此，在少量的迭代之后，冻结开发的某些部分(如规范)并继续进行后期的开发阶段是正常的。问题被留到以后解决，或者被忽略，或者被编程处理。开发任务的过早冻结可能意味着系统无法交付用户所期望的内容。 During the final life cycle phase (operation and maintenance) the software is put into use. Errors and omissions in the original software requirements are discovered. Program and design errors emerge and the need for new functionality is identified. The system must therefore evolve to remain useful. Making these changes (software maintenance) may involve repeating previous process stages.在软件生命周期的最后阶段(操作和维护)，软件投入使用。发现原始软件需求中的错误和遗漏。出现程序和设计错误，识别新功能的需求。因此，系统必须不断发展才能保持有用。进行这些更改(软件维护)可能涉及重复前面的过程阶段。 In the Waterfall Model, documentation is produced at each phase. This makes the process visible so managers can monitor progress against the development plan. Its major problem is the inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages. Commitments must be made at an early stage in the process, which makes it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements. In principle, the waterfall model should only be used when the requirements are well understood and unlikely to change radically during system development.在瀑布模型中，每个阶段都会生成文档。这使得过程可见，以便管理人员可以根据开发计划监控进度。它的主要问题是不灵活地将项目划分为不同的阶段。必须在流程的早期阶段做出承诺，这使得很难响应客户不断变化的需求。原则上，瀑布模型只应该在需求被很好地理解并且不太可能在系统开发过程中发生根本变化的情况下使用。 Incremental development Incremental development is based on the idea of developing an initial implementation, exposing this to user comment and evolving it through several versions until an adequate system has been developed. Specification, development, and validation activities are interleaved rather than separate, with rapid feedback across activities. Incremental software development, which is a fundamental part of agile approaches, is better than a waterfall approach for most business, e-commerce, and personal systems.增量开发基于这样的想法:开发一个初始实现，将其公开给用户评论，并通过几个版本对其进行改进，直到开发出一个合适的系统。规范、开发和验证活动是交错而不是分离的，活动之间有快速的反馈。增量软件开发是敏捷方法的基本部分，对于大多数业务、电子商务和个人系统来说，增量软件开发比瀑布方法要好。 By developing the software incrementally, it is cheaper and easier to make changes in the software as it is being developed. Each increment or version of the system incorporates some of the functionality that is needed by the customer. Generally, the early increments of the system include the most important or most urgently required functionality. This means that the customer can evaluate the system at a relatively early stage in the development to see if it delivers what is required. If not, then only the current increment has to be changed and, possibly, new functionality defined for later increments.通过增量式开发软件，在开发过程中对软件进行更改更便宜也更容易。系统的每个增量或版本都包含了客户需要的一些功能。通常，系统的早期增量包括最重要或最迫切需要的功能。这意味着客户可以在开发的相对早期阶段评估系统，看看它是否交付了所需的内容。如果没有，那么只需要更改当前的增量，并且可能为以后的增量定义新的功能。 Incremental development has three important benefits, compared to the waterfall model: 相比于瀑布模型的优势 The cost of accommodating changing customer requirements is reduced. 降低了适应客户需求变化的成本。 It is easier to get customer feedback on the development work that has been done. 对于已经完成的开发工作，更容易获得客户的反馈。 More rapid delivery and deployment of useful software to the customer is possible, even if all of the functionality has not been included. 即使没有包含所有的功能，也可以更快速地向客户交付和部署有用的软件。 From a management perspective, the incremental approach has two problems: the process is not visible. 流程不可视 system structure tends to degrade as new increments are added. 系统结构会随着增量的增加而降低 Other problems with incremental development includes: large organizations have bureaucratic procedures that have evolved over time and there may be a mismatch between these procedures and a more informal iterative or agile process. 大型组织的官僚程序随着时间的推移而演变，在这些程序和更非正式的迭代或敏捷过程之间可能存在不匹配。 Formal procedures are required by external regulations (e.g., accounting regulations) The problems of incremental development become particularly acute for large, complex, long-lifetime systems, where different teams develop different parts of the system. Large systems need a stable framework or architecture and the responsibilities of the different teams working on parts of the system need to be clearly defined with respect to that architecture. This has to be planned in advance rather than developed incrementally.对于大型、复杂、长生命周期的系统，增量开发的问题变得特别尖锐，在这些系统中，不同的团队开发系统的不同部分。大型系统需要一个稳定的框架或体系结构，不同团队在系统部分的工作职责需要根据该体系结构明确定义。这必须提前计划，而不是渐进地开发。 Reuse-oriented software engineering In the majority of software projects, there are some forms of informal software reuse. This informal reuse takes place irrespective of the development process that is used. In the 21st century, software development processes that focus on the reuse of existing software have become widely used. Reuse-oriented approaches rely on a large base of reusable software components and an integrating framework for the composition of these components.在大多数软件项目中，有一些非正式的软件重用形式。这种非正式的重用与所使用的开发过程无关。在21世纪，注重现有软件重用的软件开发过程得到了广泛的应用。面向重用的方法依赖于大量的可重用软件组件和用于这些组件组合的集成框架。 Three types of software component that may be used in a reuse-oriented process: Web services that are developed according to service standards and which are available for remote invocation. 根据服务标准开发并可用于远程调用的Web服务。 Collections of objects that are developed as a package to be integrated with a component framework such as .NET or J2EE. 对象的集合被开发成一个包，与组件框架集成。 Stand-alone software systems that are configured for use in a particular environment. 配置为在特定环境中使用的独立软件系统。 Advantages reducing the amount of software to be developed and so reducing cost and risks. 减少需要开发的软件数量，从而降低成本和风险。 usually also leads to faster delivery of the software. 通常也会导致更快的软件交付。 However, requirements compromises are inevitable and this may lead to a system that does not meet the real needs of users. Furthermore, some control over the system evolution is lost as new versions of the reusable components are not under the control of the organization using them.然而，需求妥协是不可避免的，这可能导致系统不能满足用户的实际需求。此外，由于可重用组件的新版本不在使用它们的组织的控制之下，对系统演化的一些控制就会丢失。 Software process activitiesThere’re four types of software process activites. Software Specification Software Design and Implementation Software Validation Software Evolution 真实的软件过程是技术、协作和管理活动的交错序列，其总体目标是指定、设计、实现和测试一个软件系统。在不同的开发过程中，规范、开发、验证和演进这四个基本过程活动的组织方式不同。 In the waterfall model, they are organized in sequence. 在瀑布模型中，它们是按顺序组织的。 In incremental development they are interleaved. 在增量开发中，它们是交错的。 How these activities are carried out depends on the type of software, people, and organizational structures involved. 这些活动如何进行取决于所涉及的软件、人员和组织结构的类型。 Software specification 软件规格说明Software specification or requirements engineering is the process of understanding and defining 软件规格说明或需求工程是理解和定义的过程 what services are required from the system 系统需要哪些服务 identifying the constraints on the system’s operation and development. 识别系统运行和发展的制约因素 Requirements engineering is a particularly critical stage of the software process as errors at this stage inevitably lead to later problems in the system design and implementation. 需求工程是软件过程中一个特别关键的阶段，因为这一阶段的错误不可避免地会导致系统设计和实现中的后续问题。 The activities of analysis, definition, and specification are interleaved. 分析、定义和规范的活动是交错的。 The requirements engineering process aims to produce an agreed requirements document that specifies a system satisfying stakeholder requirements. 需求工程过程的目的是产生一个商定的需求文档，指定一个满足涉众需求的系统。 规格一般分为两层级细节。Requirements are usually presented at two levels of detail. End-users and customers need a high-level statement of the requirements; 终端用户和客户需要高层次的需求说明; system developers need a more detailed system specification. 系统开发人员需要一个更详细的系统规范。 There are four main activities in the requirements engineering process: 在工程过程需求中一般有四种活动 Feasibility study 可行性研究 Requirements elicitation and analysis 需求提取和分析 Requirements specification 需求规范 Requirements validation 需求验证 Software design and implementationThe implementation stage of software development is the process of converting a system specification into an executable system. It always involves processes of software design and programming but, if an incremental approach to development is used, may also involve refinement of the software specification. A software design is a description of the structure of the software to be implemented, the data models and structures used by the system, the interfaces between system components and, sometimes, the algorithms used. 软件开发的实现阶段是将系统规范转换为可执行系统的过程。它总是涉及到软件设计和编程的过程，但是，如果使用增量开发方法，也可能涉及到软件规范的细化。软件设计是描述要实现的软件的结构、系统使用的数据模型和结构、系统组件之间的接口，有时还包括使用的算法。 设计师不会立即完成设计，而是反复开发设计。他们在开发设计的过程中添加了正式性和细节，不断回溯以纠正早期的设计。 Design activities Architectural design, where you identify the overall structure of the system, the principal components (sometimes called sub-systems or modules), their relationships, and how they are distributed. 架构设计，确定系统的整体结构、主要组件，它们之间的关系以及它们是如何分布的。 Interface design, where you define the interfaces between system components. This interface specification must be unambiguous. 接口设计，定义系统组件之间的接口。这个接口规范必须是明确的。 Component design, where you take each system component and design how it will operate. 组件设计，将每个系统组件设计成如何运行。 a simple statement of the expected functionalities. 对预期功能的简单说明 a list of changes to be made to a reusable component. 可重用组件的更改列表 a detailed design model (model-driven approach). 详细的设计模型 Database design, where you design the system data structures and how these are to be represented in a database. 数据库设计，即设计系统数据结构以及如何在数据库中表示这些结构。 The detail and representation of the design output vary considerably. For critical systems, detailed design documents setting out precise and accurate descriptions of the system must be produced. 对于关键系统，必须编制详细的设计文件，对系统进行精确的描述。 If a model-driven approach is used, these outputs may mostly be diagrams. 如果使用模型驱动的方法，这些输出可能主要是图。 Where agile methods of development are used, the outputs of the design process may not be separate specification documents but may be represented in the code of the program. 在使用敏捷开发方法的情况下，设计过程的输出可能不是单独的规格文件，而是在程序代码中表示。 Software validation There’re three testing process: 三种test process Development testing 开发测试 - The components making up the system are tested by the people developing the system. Each component is tested independently, without other system components. System testing 系统测试 - System components are integrated to create a complete system. This process is concerned with finding errors that result from unanticipated interactions between components and component interface problems. Acceptance testing 验收测试 - This is the final stage in the testing process before the system is accepted for operational use. The system is tested with data supplied by the system customer rather than with simulated test data. Tutorial questionsQ: Giving reasons for your answer based on the type of system being developed, suggest the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used as a basis for managing the development of the following systems. A system to control anti-lock braking in a car A virtual reality system to support software maintenance A university accounting system that replaces an existing system An interactive travel planning system that helps users plan journeys with the lowest environmental impact A: Anti-lock braking system. This is a safety-critical system so requires a lot of up-front analysis before implementation. It certainly needs a plan-driven approach to development with the requirements carefully analysed. A waterfall model is therefore the most appropriate approach to use, perhaps with formal transformations between the different development stages. Virtual reality system. This is a system where the requirements will change and there will be an extensive user interface components. Incremental development with, perhaps, some UI prototyping is the most appropriate model. An agile process may be used. University accounting system. This is a system whose requirements are fairly well-known and which will be used in an environment in conjunction with lots of other systems such as a research grant management system. Therefore, a reuse-based approach is likely to be appropriate for this. Interactive travel planning system. System with a complex user interface. An incremental development approach is the most appropriate as the system requirements will change as real user experience with the system is gained. PS: To be honest, I am quite confused about this reference answer cus NEITHER OF THESE ANSWERS is in the slides. So just have a glance at the answer, it’s common to stuck on these questions. Q: Explain why incremental development is the most effective approach for developing business software systems. Why is this model less appropriate for real-time systems engineering?A: Business software systems usually complex, software intensive, and frequently being changes when business goals or processes are changed. So incremental development is better. 业务目标或过程发生变化时经常发生变化。所以增量开发更好。Real-time systems usually involve many hardware components which are not easy to change and cannot be incremental. Also real-time systems usually safety critical which needed be built based on well planned process. 实时系统通常包含许多硬件组件，这些硬件组件不容易更改，也不能增量。此外，实时系统通常是安全的关键，需要建立在良好的计划过程。 Q: Consider the reuse-based process model. Explain why it is essential to have two separate requirements engineering activities in the process.A:In a reuse based process, you need two requirements engineering activities because it is essential to adapt the system requirements according to the capabilities of the system/components to be reused. These activities are: An initial activity where you understand the function of the system and set out broad requirements for what the system should do. These should be expressed in sufficient detail that you can use them as a basis for deciding of a system/component satisfies some of the requirements and so can be reused. 一个初步的活动，在这个活动中，您了解系统的功能，并为系统应该做什么设定广泛的需求。这些应该以足够详细的方式表达，以便您可以将它们作为决定系统/组件是否满足某些需求的基础，从而可以重用。 Once systems/components have been selected, you need a more detailed requirements engineering activity to check that the features of the reused software meet the business needs and to identify changes and additions that are required. 一旦选择了系统/组件，您需要一个更详细的需求工程活动来检查重用软件的特性是否满足业务需求，并确定所需的更改和添加。 Q: Suggest why it is important to make a distinction between developing the user requirements and developing system requirements in the requirements engineering process.A:There is a fundamental difference between the user and the system requirements that mean they should be considered separately. The user requirements are intended to describe the system’s functions and features from a user perspective and it is essential that users understand these requirements. They should be expressed in natural language and may not be expressed in great detail, to allow some implementation flexibility. The people involved in the process must be able to understand the user’s environment and application domain. 用户需求旨在从用户的角度描述系统的功能和特性，用户理解这些需求是至关重要的。总的来说就是用户没有方法表达的太清楚，需要开发人员理解用户的需求。 The system requirements are much more detailed than the user requirements and are intended to be a precise specification of the system that may be part of a system contract. They may also be used in situations where development is outsourced and the development team need a complete specification of what should be developed. The system requirements are developed after user requirements have been established. 系统需求要比用户需求详细得多，并且要成为系统合同的一部分的系统的精确规范。当开发被外包，并且开发团队需要一个完整的关于应该开发什么的规范时，也可以使用它们。系统需求是在建立用户需求之后开发的。 References XJTLU MC PowerPoint Slides (CPT203 Week2 Lecture2)","link":"/2021/08/23/Preview-CPT203-W2/"},{"title":"Preview CAN201 W2","text":"This is the preview note of CAN201(introduction to networking).

Host - Program process: a program running within a host processes in different / same hosts: socket can be used to exchange messages Processes in the same host: Inter-process communication defined by OS CS architecture: Client process: initiates communication Server process: waits to be contacted P2P architecture: client process / server process on the same host Addressing processes Host device has unique 32-bit IPv4 and/or 128-bit IPv6 Process network identifier: IPv4:port 192.168.1.100:80 [IPv6]:port [240e:3a1:4cb1:69d0:f40c:4269:74a2:7ea3]:80 App-layer protocol defines Types of messages exchanged request, response Message syntax what fields in messages &amp; how fields are delineated Message semantics: meaning of information in fields Message timing: when and how Open protocols: 开放协议 Defined in RFCs Allows for interoperability e.g., HTTP, SMTP, FTP Closed protocols: 关闭协议 e.g., Skype, Games, you own protocols… Transport service requirementsThere’re 4 requirements in transport service: data integrity throughput timing security Internet transport protocols services TCP 传输控制协议 UDP 用户数据报协议 TCP service Reliable transport between sending and receiving process 发送和接收过程之间的可靠传输 Flow control 流量控制: sender won’t overwhelm receiver 发送方不会淹没接收方 Congestion control 拥塞控制: throttle sender when network overloaded 当网络过载时限制发送者 Does not offer 不提供: timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security 记时，最低吞吐量保证，安全性 Connection-oriented 面向连接: setup required between client and server processes 需要在客户端和服务器进程之间进行设置 Internet transport protocols servicesThe problems with UDP service: unreliable data transfer between sending and recieving process Does not offer: reliability, flow control, congestion control, timing, throughput guarantee, security, or connection setup. 可靠性,流量控制,拥塞控制,时间,吞吐量保证,安全性或连接设置 Securing TCPSecure Sockets Layer - SSL TCP &amp; UDP No encryption 无加密 Cleartext psws 明文程序状态字 –&gt; Internet SSL Provides encrypted TCP connection 提供加密TCP连接 Data integrity 数据完整性 End-point authentication 端点认证 SSL is at app layer Apps use SSL libraries, that “talk” to TCP SSL socket API Cleartext psw 明文程序状态字 –&gt; encrypted psw –&gt; Internet Web applicationWeb, HTTP and WWW World Wide Web: WWW HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Web page consists of base HTML-file which includes several referenced objects, addressable by a URL HTTP overviewHTTP: hypertext transfer protocol 超文本传输协议 Application layer protocol Client/server model Client: browser that requests, receives, (using HTTP protocol) and show Web objects (Render) Server: Web server sends (using HTTP protocol) objects in response to requests Uses TCP: Client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server, port 80 客户端发起TCP连接到服务器，端口80 Server accepts TCP connection from client 服务器接受来自客户端的TCP连接 HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser (HTTP client) and Web server (HTTP server) 在浏览器和Web服务器之间交换HTTP消息 TCP connection closed TCP连接关闭 HTTP is “stateless”: server maintains no information about past client requests. HTTP是“无状态的”:服务器不维护关于过去客户端请求的信息。 Protocols that maintain “state” are complex! past history (state) must be maintained. if server/client crashed, their view of “state” may be inconsistent, must be reconciled. 如果服务器/客户端崩溃，他们的“状态”视图可能不一致，必须协调 Non-persistent HTTP 非持久性HTTP At most one object sent over TCP connection 最多一个对象通过TCP连接发送 Downloading multiple objects required multiple connections 下载多个对象需要多个连接Persistent HTTP 持久HTTP Multiple objects can be sent over single TCP connection between client, server 客户端和服务器之间可以通过单个TCP连接发送多个对象 Non-response time Persistent HTTPNon-persistent HTTP issues Requires 2 RTTs per object 每个对象需要2个rtt OS overhead for each TCP connection 每个TCP连接的操作系统开销 Browsers often open parallel TCP connections to fetch referenced objects 浏览器经常打开并行TCP连接来获取引用的对象Persistent HTTP issues Server leaves connection open after sending response 服务器在发送响应后保持连接打开 Subsequent HTTP messages between same client/server sent over open connection 在同一个客户端/服务器之间通过开放连接发送的后续HTTP消息 Client sends requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object 客户端一遇到引用对象就发送请求 As little as one RTT for all the referenced objects 对于所有引用的对象，只有一个RTT Persistent HTTP is not perfect HTTP request message Two types of HTTP messages: request, response HTTP 1.x request message: ASCII (human-readable format) general format HTTP 1.1 methodWhat do we need from a web protocol?Get, Create, Modify, Delete —- resource / data / information HTTP 1.0 1.1 Additional methodsGet, Post, Put, Delete, Patch —- Safe MethodsHead, Trace, Options, Connect —- Idempotent Methods 幂等方法 HTTP response status codes Status code appears in 1st line in server-to-client response message.

SMTP服务器将通过SMTP协议将消息发送到该服务器。 The receiving server will store the message and make it available to the recipient (Bob), who can access it via web, POP, or IMAP. 接收服务器将存储消息并使其对接收方可用，接收方可以通过web、POP或IMAP访问该消息。 Email ProtocolsDelivery: SMTP: simple mail transfer protocol[RFC2821, Apr. 2001]Receive: POP3 - Post Office Protocol - Version 3[RFC1939, May 1996] IMAP - Internet Message Access Protocol[RFC3501, Mar. 2003] Exchange ActiveSync – Microsoft’s protocol[from 2002] Lab都是学过的。Pass!

The lecture of this week is mainly discussing about Introduction: hardware and software. LectureWhat is Computer graphics?‘Computer Graphics’ is concerned with all aspects of producing pictures or images using a computer. There are three closely related meanings, each representing a different perspective on the same thing. the images that you see on the computer screen the computer code that is used to create the images a mathematical model of the real-world (which is sometimes called the virtual world) When working at the most advanced levels of Computer Graphics, the computer graphics specialist will create a virtual world implement the virtual world in computer code run the code to see life-like images on the computer screen How do the individual subjects relate?Two subjects are at the heart of computer graphics: 2D Computer Graphics 3D Computer Graphics What are the application areas?

FramebufferWhat is framebuffer?A block of memory, dedicated to graphics output, that holds the contents of what will be displayed. What is pixel?An element of the framebuffer. Framebuffer in memoryIf we want a framebuffer of 640 pixels by 480 pixles.How many bits should we allocate?framebuffer = 640*480 bitsQ: What do more bits get you?A: More values to be stored at each pixel. bit depthNumber of bits allocated per pixel in a buffer. How much memory we allocate to store the color at each pixel?Common Aswer: 32bits RGBA 32 bits perpixel (true colour) 8 bits for red, green, blue and alpha potential for 256 reds, greens and blues total colours: 16,777,216 (more than the eye can distinguish) Data type refresher7 types of data type refresher: bit - a 0 or 1. Can represent 2 unique values. byte - 8 bits or 256 values. word - 32 bits or 4,294,967,296 values. int - 32 bits. float - 32 bits. double - 64 bits. unsigned byte - 8 bits. How much memory is on our graphic card?三种，分别是: 640 * 480, 1024 * 768, 1600 * 1200 640 * 480 * 32 bits = 1,228,800 bytes 1024 * 768 * 32 bits = 3,145,728 bytes 1600 * 1200 * 32 bits = 7,680,000 bytes Framebuffer -&gt; monitorThe values in the framebuffer are converted from a digital (1s and 0s representation, the bits) to an analog signal that goes out to the monitor. This is done automatically (not controlled by your code), and the conversion can be done while writing to the framebuffer. 帧缓冲区中的值被从数字转换为输出到监视器的模拟信号。这是自动完成的，转换可以在写入framebuffer时完成。 Image quility issues Screen resolution Colour Refresh rate Brightness Contrast Sensitivity of display to viewing angle PixelsPixel: The most basic addressable image element in a screen CRT: Colour triad (RGB phosphor dots) LCD: Single colour elementScreen resolution: measure of number of pixels on a screen.

The lecture of this week is mainly discussing about Preliminaries: principal mathematical ideas necessary to understand the material of the course. Decision, Computation and LanguageThis module is about the theory of computation and answering the question: “What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?” 这个模块是关于计算理论的，并回答这个问题:“计算机的基本能力和局限性是什么?”The central theme: Are the languagues, their membership problems can not be solved (computed) Algorithmically. Lecture 1LanguageFormal languages have the property that there is a precise rule that governs what strings belong to the language.正式语言包括了programming languages, database query languages, various file formats.然而English, Mandarin这种并不是Formal languages. what the module is about notations for representing formal languages. These give us ways to define them precisely ways to build compilers that recognise the languages ways to check whether a string of symbols belongs to a language whether two alternative descriptions of languages are actually the same language tools to analyse languages natural languages (NL): want to recognise valid sentence programming languages (PL): want to recognise valid program Some notations/methods for describing a language (other than explicitly listing it) include finite state automaton 有限状态自动机 regular expressions 正则表达式 context-free grammar 上下文无关语法 pushdown Automation 叠加自动化 Turing machine 图灵机 Observations 语法可以生成毫无意义的句子。 可以生成任意长的句子。 语义可以根据语法来确定，例如由单词“and”组成的子句的逻辑连接。 语法可以扩展到处理从句、副词等。 你不能完全用这种方式定义自然语言句子，但你可以用这种方式定义编程语言。 Stages of compilation lexical analysis: divide sequence of characters into tokens, such as variable names, operators, labels. In a natural language tokens are strings of consecutive letters (easy to recognise!) 将字符序列划分为符号 parsing: identify relationships between tokens 辨别符号之间的关系 code generation: generate object code 集成目标代码 code optimisation 代码优化 lexical analysis1pay=salary+(overtimerate*overtime); Break into tokens as follows: 12345678pay=salary+( overtimerate ∗overtime); Parse Tree Definitions and notationNothing serious, man. LanguagesSame as the above one. Lecture 2Deterministic Finite Automata 确定性有限自动机Can be used a model for what happens during lexical analysis — scan program from beginning to end and divide it into tokens. 可以用一个模型来描述词法分析过程中发生的事情——从头到尾扫描程序，并将其划分为标记。Finite automata are used to specify tokens of programming languages. 有限自动机用于指定编程语言的标记。Also used in “model checking”, reasoning about systems with objective of proving they satisfy useful properties. 也用于“模型检验”，即以证明系统满足有用性质为目标的推理。Also used in statistical models for analysing biological and textual sequences. 也用于分析生物和文本序列的统计模型。 A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) has 5 components: Q is a finite nonempty set whose members are called states of theautomaton; Q是一个有限的非空集，其成员称为自动机的状态; A is a finite nonempty set called the alphabet of the automaton; A是一个有限的非空集被叫做字母表的自动机; φ is a map from Q × A to Q called the transition function of the automaton; φ是一个从Q × a到Q的映射，称为自动机的转移函数; i is a member of Q and is called the initial state; i是Q的一个元素，称为初始状态; T is a nonempty subset of Q whose members are called terminal states or accepting states. T是Q的一个非空子集，其成员称为终端状态或接受状态。 State of a machine tells you something about the prefix that has been read so far. If the string is a member of the language of interest, the state reached when the whole string has been scanned will be an accepting state (a member of T ). 机器的状态告诉您有关到目前为止已读取的前缀的一些信息。如果字符串是感兴趣的语言的成员，当整个字符串被扫描时达到的状态将是接受状态。Transition function φ tells you how state should change when an additional letter is read by the DFA转移函数φ告诉你当DFA读取一个额外的字母时状态应该如何变化。DFA常被描述为一个有标记的有向图。 Initially the state is i and if the input word is w = a1a2 …an then, as each letter is read, the state changes and we get q1, q2, . . . , qn defined by An important observationAny DFA that uses the convention that an undefined transition leads to a rejection, can be converted to a DFA that uses a total transition function (that is, one that is defined for all combinations of input symbols and states). The convention is useful, but it does not add extra expressive power. 任何使用未定义转换导致拒绝约定的DFA，都可以转换为使用总转换函数(即为所有输入符号和状态组合定义的转换函数)的DFA。这种约定是有用的，但并没有增加额外的表达能力。 Any finite language is accepted by some DFAGeneral rule: i is the initial state. For each prefix p of a word in the list, include state sp with the idea that the machine should be in state sp after p has been read. i是初始状态。对于列表中每个单词的前缀p，包含状态sp，即在读取p之后，机器应该处于状态sp。 References XJTLU MC PowerPoint slides (INT201 Lecture1 &amp; Lecture2)","link":"/2021/08/15/Preview-INT201-W1/"},{"title":"hexo部署步骤变化","text":"Problem今天写完blog上传的时候，发现原来的GitHub输入用户名再输入密码push的方式没用了，报错如下: 1234567891011remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.

Understand that the development of different types of software systems may require different software engineering techniques. Understand some ethical and professional issues that are important for software engineers. Chapter 1 is recommended for reference. BasicWhat’s a computer software?Computer software is the product that software professionals build and then support over the long term. It encompasses computer programs and associated documentation that execute within a computer of any size and architecture. Software products may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market. 计算机软件是软件专业人员构建并长期支持的产品。它包括在任何大小和结构的计算机中执行的计算机程序和相关的文档。软件产品可能是针对特定客户开发的，也可能是针对一般市场开发的。 Why is it important?Hence it affects nearly every aspect of our lives and has become pervasive(无处不在的) in our commerce, our culture, and our everyday activities. 影响人们生活的各个方面… What is software engineering?Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production. 软件工程是一门涉及软件生产的各个方面的工程学科。 IntroductionSoftware engineering is essential for the functioning of national and international societies. 不可缺少的。 Software failure &amp; successSoftware engineering is criticized as inadequate for modern software development. 被批评不适合现代软件开发。(wtf哪什么适合?) Two factors of failures increasing demands 增加的需求 low expectations 低期望值 However, we’re still gonna learn these shits.😅 Professional software development Amateur People in business write spreadsheet programs to simplify their jobs scientists and engineers write programs to process their experimental data hobbyists write programs for their own interest and enjoyment Professional vast majority of software development is a professional activity where software is developed for specific business purposes, for inclusion in other devices, or as software products such as information systems, CAD systems, etc. intended for use by someone apart from its developer is usually developed by teams rather than individuals It is maintained and changed throughout its life. Four important attributesFour important attributes that all professional software Maintainability 可维护性 Dependability and security 可靠性和安全性 Efficiency 效率 Acceptability 可接受性 Two kinds of software products Generic software products Customized software products The distinction between these system product types is becoming increasingly blurred. 两者之间的界限越来越模糊。 Software deterioration软件恶化软件是逻辑的而不是物理的系统元素，所以软件不会磨损。因此软件的故障率曲线应该是如图所示的“理想曲线”的形式，但实际上，在其生命周期内，软件将经历变化。当进行更改时，很可能会引入错误，导致故障率曲线出现如“实际曲线”所示的峰值。 Software engineeringSoftware engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use. 软件工程是一门工程学科，它涉及软件生产的各个方面，从系统规范的早期阶段到系统投入使用后的维护。 Engineering discipline工程纪律就是软件工程师工作的纪律规定。 All aspects of software production软件工程不仅仅涉及软件开发的技术过程。它还包括诸如软件项目管理和支持软件生产的工具、方法和理论的开发等活动。 Software engineering approachesA software process is a sequence of activities that leads to the production of a software product. 在软件工程中使用的系统方法被称为software process。Four fundamental activities: Software specification 软件规范 Software development 软件开发 Software validation 软件验证 Software evolution 软件进化 Software engineering diversityDifferent types of systems need different development processes. Software engineering is a systematic approach to the production of software that takes into account practical cost, schedule, and dependability issues, as well as the needs of software customers and producers. 软件工程是软件生产的一种系统方法，考虑实际成本、进度和可靠性问题，以及软件客户和生产商的需求。 How this systematic approach is actually implemented varies dramatically depending on the organization developing the software, the type of software, and the people involved in the development process. 根据软件开发的组织、软件的类型以及参与开发过程的人员的不同，这种系统方法的实际实现方式有很大的不同。 Two major approaches: Sequential 顺序 Iterative 迭代 Software engineering ethics You must also behave in an ethical and morally responsible way if you are to be respected as a professional engineer. 作为一名专业工程师，如果你想受到尊重，你的行为必须符合道德规范和负责任的态度。 You should not use your skills and abilities to behave in a dishonest way or in a way that will bring disrepute to the software engineering profession. 你不应该使用你的技能和能力以一种不诚实的方式行事，或者以一种会给软件工程专业带来声誉的方式行事。 在某些领域，可接受的行为标准不受法律约束，而是受到更模糊的职业责任概念的约束。 Confidentiality 保密 Competence 能力 Intellectual property rights 知识产权 Computer misuse 计算机滥用 References XJTLU MC PowerPoint Slides (CPT203 Week1 Lecture1)","link":"/2021/08/14/Preview-CPT203-W1/"},{"title":"Preview CAN201 W1","text":"This is the preview note of CAN201(introduction to networking).

CSS&amp;HTML5的内容这部分内容其实挺多挺杂的，因为hexo框架和yilia本身就带了很多内容，而且格式很乱，非常难以辨别，主要可以使用Chrome浏览器的开发者模式去定位需要修改的模块和内容，再去vscode里搜索直接进行修改，这样会方便一些。","link":"/2021/08/01/hexo%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E/"},{"title":"Markdown的语法知识","text":"这是一篇简单介绍和记录Markdown语法的笔记，参考的一些网上的资料和CSDN的文章。 I. 标题1.使用#表示标题其中#必须在行首，在标题的前面的#越少，标题的字体就越大 （从一个#到五个#都有） 2.使用===或者---表示例如：一级标题用===二级标题用--- II. 分割线使用三个或以上的-或者*表示，且这一行只有符号，注意不要被识别为二级标题即可，例如可以为往中间或者前面加上空格- - -* * * III. 斜体和粗体使用*和**分别表示斜体和粗体，例如：斜体 粗体 斜体+粗体删除线用两个～，例如：～～这是要删除的文字～～删除文字部分失败了，不过感觉用处不大 IV. 超链接和图片超链接和图片的写法类似，图片仅在超链接之间多加了一个!超链接写法分别是：网站写法(Google)图片的例子: V. 无序列表使用-,+,*表示无序列表，前后留一行空白，可以嵌套，例如： 一层 二层 二层 三层 四层 一层 VI. 有序列表使用1. （点后面有个空格）表示有序列表 一层 一层 这一级别的列表没有显示出序号 一层 VII. 文字应用使用&gt;表示，可以有多个&gt;，表示层次更深 the first floor the second flooralthough i used the &gt; in the beginning. this is still the second floor the third floor have a line of space. here is the first floor now VIII. 行内代码块用`表示:行内代码块有一些字符需要转译，使用反斜杠\\进行转译 IX. 代码块使用四个缩进表示代码块，一般使用三个`表示 public static void main(String[] args){ System.out.println(“Hello World”); }上面的代码没有按照要求显示出来，不过底下的已经出来了上面的意义不大，以底下的写法为准下面是有highlight和行数提醒的代码 123public static void main(String[] args){ System.out.println(&quot;Hello World);} X. 表格直接看例子，第二行的---:表示了对齐方式，默认左对齐，还有右对齐和居中|商品|数量|单价||—|—:|:—:||苹果|10|$1||电脑|1|$1000|表格失败了，没有显示出来，需要完善 XI. 流程图主要的语法为 name=&gt;type: describe，其中type主要有以下几种：1.开始和结束：start end2.输入输出：inputoutput3.操作：operation4.条件：condition5.子程序：subroutine语法参考网站：流程图语法参考估计流程图很少用得上 XII. 数学公式使用$表示，其中一个$表示在行内，两个$表示独占一行$$E=mc^2$$支持LaTeX编辑显示，访问MathJax参考更多用法推荐一个数学公式在线编译网站：https://private.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php今天增加了矩阵的写法，假如我们想要在markdown中实现一个矩阵，也需要用Mathjex。 123456$$ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\\\\\\\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\\\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$$ 上面的代码实现出来的效果👇$$ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\\\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$$假如要更换矩阵的括号，需要修改{bmatrix}变成其他的标志符。 XIII. 支持HTML标签1. 段落的缩进例如想要段落的缩进，可以如下：&nbsp;&nbsp;不断行的空白格&nbsp;或 &ensp;&ensp;半方大的空白&ensp;或 &emsp;&emsp;全方大的空白&emsp;或  2. 页面内跳转点我跳转点我跳转的功能这里演示不了，写法如下： &lt;h6 id='anchor'&gt;我是一个锚点&lt;/h6&gt; XIV. 参考文章Markdown语法介绍（详细）","link":"/2021/07/29/markdown%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95/"}],"tags":[{"name":"XJTLU","slug":"XJTLU","link":"/tags/XJTLU/"},{"name":"CAN201","slug":"CAN201","link":"/tags/CAN201/"},{"name":"Lecture","slug":"Lecture","link":"/tags/Lecture/"},{"name":"Lab","slug":"Lab","link":"/tags/Lab/"},{"name":"CPT203","slug":"CPT203","link":"/tags/CPT203/"},{"name":"CPT205","slug":"CPT205","link":"/tags/CPT205/"},{"name":"INT201","slug":"INT201","link":"/tags/INT201/"},{"name":"Tutorial","slug":"Tutorial","link":"/tags/Tutorial/"},{"name":"flutter","slug":"flutter","link":"/tags/flutter/"},{"name":"dart","slug":"dart","link":"/tags/dart/"},{"name":"blog","slug":"blog","link":"/tags/blog/"},{"name":"yilia","slug":"yilia","link":"/tags/yilia/"},{"name":"hexo","slug":"hexo","link":"/tags/hexo/"},{"name":"icarus","slug":"icarus","link":"/tags/icarus/"},{"name":"Markdown","slug":"Markdown","link":"/tags/Markdown/"}],"categories":[{"name":"XJTLU note","slug":"XJTLU-note","link":"/categories/XJTLU-note/"},{"name":"CPT205","slug":"XJTLU-note/CPT205","link":"/categories/XJTLU-note/CPT205/"},{"name":"CAN201","slug":"XJTLU-note/CAN201","link":"/categories/XJTLU-note/CAN201/"},{"name":"INT201","slug":"XJTLU-note/INT201","link":"/categories/XJTLU-note/INT201/"},{"name":"SURF note","slug":"SURF-note","link":"/categories/SURF-note/"},{"name":"CPT203","slug":"XJTLU-note/CPT203","link":"/categories/XJTLU-note/CPT203/"},{"name":"blog note","slug":"blog-note","link":"/categories/blog-note/"},{"name":"problem solving","slug":"problem-solving","link":"/categories/problem-solving/"}]}
